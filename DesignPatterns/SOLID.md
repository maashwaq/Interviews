1. SOLID design patterns in single lines

SOLID is a set of design principles that help developers create software that is easier to maintain and extend. Each principle can be summarized in a single line as follows:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Note that these principles are meant to work together, and following them can help developers create software that is more maintainable, extensible, and adaptable to change over time.

2. Solid understanding of Object Oriented Design Methodology and Design Patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer, Proxy, Demand

Object-oriented design (OOD) methodology is a way of designing software systems that are based on objects, which are the basic building blocks of the system. OOD involves identifying the objects in a system, defining their attributes and behaviors, and determining how they interact with each other to achieve the system's overall functionality.

Design patterns are solutions to common software design problems that have been proven to be effective in practice. They provide reusable templates for solving similar problems in different contexts. Some of the most commonly used design patterns are Singleton, Factory, Observer, Proxy, and Command.

**Singleton**: This pattern is used when we need to ensure that a class has only one instance, and that instance is globally accessible. This can be useful in situations where we want to maintain a single point of control over a resource, such as a database connection or a logging service.

**Factory**: This pattern is used when we need to create objects without exposing the object creation logic to the client. A factory is responsible for creating objects of a specific type based on client requirements, and it can be useful in situations where we need to create multiple objects of a specific type with different configurations.

**Observer**: This pattern is used when we need to maintain a list of dependents, or observers, that are notified whenever a specific object or state changes. This pattern is useful in situations where we want to decouple the observer from the observable, allowing them to evolve independently.

**Proxy**: This pattern is used when we want to provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object, which can control access to that object. This can be useful in situations where we need to add additional functionality to an object, such as caching or security checks, without modifying the object itself.

**Command**: This pattern is used when we need to encapsulate a request as an object, allowing us to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. This pattern can be useful in situations where we need to decouple the requester from the actual execution of the request, allowing us to support a wide range of different request types.

Overall, having a solid understanding of OOD methodology and design patterns is essential for developing software systems that are scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to changing requirements. By leveraging these concepts, we can design software systems that are flexible, modular, and easy to extend and modify over time.
