1. SOLID design patterns in single lines

SOLID is a set of design principles that help developers create software that is easier to maintain and extend. Each principle can be summarized in a single line as follows:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Note that these principles are meant to work together, and following them can help developers create software that is more maintainable, extensible, and adaptable to change over time.
