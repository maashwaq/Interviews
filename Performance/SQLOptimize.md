Optimizing business logic and SQL queries can significantly enhance performance. Here are some tips:

**Use Indexes**: Indexes can help the database system locate and retrieve data more quickly, reducing the time it takes to execute queries. Ensure that the indexes are properly defined and that they cover all the columns that are frequently used in the queries.

**Avoid using subqueries**: Subqueries can be slow, especially if they are nested. Try to use JOINs instead of subqueries whenever possible.

**Use Stored Procedures**: Stored procedures can help reduce the amount of code that needs to be executed on the database server, which can lead to faster performance.

**Optimize the database schema**: Ensure that the database schema is designed to minimize joins and data duplication. This can improve the speed of queries.

**Use appropriate data types**: Ensure that you are using the appropriate data types for columns in the database. Using the wrong data type can lead to slower performance.

**Use appropriate indexing strategies**: Choose appropriate indexing strategies for tables, such as clustered and non-clustered indexes.

**Use appropriate normalization levels**: Ensure that your database is normalized to the appropriate level. Over-normalization can lead to slower performance.

**Use Query Optimization tools**: Use tools like EXPLAIN PLAN or SQL Profiler to identify slow queries and optimize them.

By implementing the above tips, you can optimize business logic and SQL queries and enhance performance by 50% or more.
