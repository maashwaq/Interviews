1. Navigate & debug Java Apps on a Linux EC2 Instance

To navigate and debug Java apps on a Linux EC2 instance, you can follow these general steps:

Connect to your Linux EC2 instance via SSH.
Install Java Development Kit (JDK) and any other required software or libraries for your Java app.
Use a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to open and edit the Java app's source code.
Compile the Java code into bytecode using the Java compiler (javac command).
Run the Java app using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) (java command).
If the Java app encounters errors or exceptions, use a debugger such as jdb or a Java IDE with built-in debugger to locate and fix the issue.
Here are more detailed instructions on how to debug a Java app on a Linux EC2 instance using jdb:

Install JDK on your Linux EC2 instance if it is not already installed. You can use the following command to install OpenJDK 11:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the path of your JDK installation:

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/
Compile your Java app's source code with debug information:

javac -g MyJavaApp.java

Run the Java app with the jdb debugger:

jdb MyJavaApp
This will start the Java debugger and attach it to your Java app.

Use the help command to see a list of available commands in jdb.

Set breakpoints in your Java code using the stop at command. For example, to set a breakpoint at line 10 of the MyJavaApp class:

stop at MyJavaApp:10
Start the execution of your Java app using the run command. The debugger will pause at the first breakpoint.

Use the step and next commands to step through your Java code one line at a time. Use the list command to see the current location in your code.

Use the print command to view the value of variables at a specific point in your code. For example, to print the value of the myVar variable:

print myVar
Use the cont command to continue the execution of your Java app until the next breakpoint is reached.

Use the exit command to exit the debugger when you are finished.

Note that using an IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA may provide a more user-friendly debugging experience. To use an IDE, you can download and install it on your local machine and then connect to your Linux EC2 instance using SSH or a remote desktop client.
