What is dependency injection in Angular?
Dependency injection is a design pattern in which a class (or component) depends on other classes (or services) to perform its functions. Angular provides a built-in dependency injection system that allows developers to easily inject services into components and other services.

What is routing in Angular?
Routing is the process of navigating between different views (or components) in an Angular application. Angular provides a built-in router that can handle different routes and parameters.

What is the difference between a template-driven form and a reactive form?
In a template-driven form, the form's structure is defined in the template, while in a reactive form, the form's structure is defined in the component. Template-driven forms are simpler to implement but less flexible, while reactive forms are more complex but more powerful.

What is Angular Universal?
