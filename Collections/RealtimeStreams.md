**Use Java Streams API to work with real time data**

The Java Streams API provides a powerful and efficient way to work with collections of data. Here's an example of how you could use it to work with real-time data:

Let's say you have a data stream that produces a series of temperature readings, and you want to find the average temperature over a certain period of time. You could use the Java Streams API to process this data in real-time, as follows:

import java.util.stream.*;

public class RealTimeDataExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // assume we have a data stream that produces temperature readings
        // we'll simulate this by creating an array of temperatures
        double[] temps = { 23.4, 24.2, 25.6, 22.1, 21.8, 24.9, 26.5, 27.1, 25.8, 23.7 };

        // create a stream of temperatures
        Stream<Double> tempStream = Arrays.stream(temps).boxed();

        // use the window method to group the temperatures into windows of 3
        Stream<Stream<Double>> windows = StreamEx.windowed(tempStream, 3);

        // map each window of temperatures to its average temperature
        Stream<Double> averages = windows.map(window -> window.mapToDouble(temp -> temp).average().getAsDouble());

        // print out the average temperature for each window
        averages.forEach(avg -> System.out.println("Average temperature: " + avg));
    }
}

In this example, we first create a data stream of temperature readings by converting an array of temperatures into a stream. We then use the windowed method from the StreamEx library (which is a third-party library that extends the Java Streams API) to group the temperatures into windows of three. We then use the map method to map each window of temperatures to its average temperature using the average method from the DoubleStream interface. Finally, we print out the average temperature for each window using the forEach method.

Note that this is just a simple example to demonstrate the basic idea of working with real-time data using the Java Streams API. In a real-world application, you would likely need to use more sophisticated techniques to handle data streams that are more complex and have higher volumes of data.
