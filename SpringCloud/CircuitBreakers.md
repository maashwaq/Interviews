01. Create Circuit Breakers with Spring Cloud

how to create Circuit Breakers with Spring Cloud.

Spring Cloud provides support for creating Circuit Breakers using the Hystrix library. Hystrix is a library that helps you isolate points of access to remote systems, services, and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failures, and provide fallback options.

To create a Circuit Breaker using Spring Cloud and Hystrix, you can follow these steps:

Add the Spring Cloud Starter Hystrix dependency to your project:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-hystrix</artifactId>
</dependency>
Annotate the method you want to wrap with a @HystrixCommand annotation. This will enable the Hystrix aspect to wrap your method in a circuit breaker.

@Service
public class MyService {
    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "fallbackMethod")
    public String myMethod() {
        // ...
    }

    public String fallbackMethod() {
        // ...
    }
}

Configure the Hystrix circuit breaker properties in your application.properties or application.yml file. Here's an example:

hystrix:
  command:
    default:
      circuitBreaker:
        enabled: true
        errorThresholdPercentage: 50
        requestVolumeThreshold: 20
        sleepWindowInMilliseconds: 5000

In this example, the circuit breaker is enabled and will open if more than 50% of requests in the last 20 requests have failed. The circuit breaker will remain open for 5 seconds before attempting to close again.

And that's it! With these three steps, you can create Circuit Breakers with Spring Cloud and Hystrix. Of course, there are many more configuration options and features available, but this should be enough to get you started.
