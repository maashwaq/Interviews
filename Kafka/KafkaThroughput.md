1. Setup Kafka to support 10mm messages / hr throughput on 2KB payloads

high-level steps to set up Kafka to support 10mm messages/hr throughput on 2KB payloads:

Choose a Kafka cluster configuration that can handle the required throughput. For example, you may need to use a multi-broker cluster with multiple partitions per topic and a replication factor of at least 2.

Choose appropriate hardware for your Kafka brokers. The number and size of the brokers will depend on your specific requirements, but you should ensure that each broker has enough CPU, memory, and disk space to handle the expected throughput.

Configure Kafka to optimize performance for 2KB payloads. This can be done by adjusting various configuration parameters, such as the message.max.bytes, replica.fetch.max.bytes, and socket.send.buffer.bytes settings.

Use a Kafka producer that is optimized for high throughput. For example, you could use the Kafka producer API with the batching feature enabled, or you could use a high-performance producer library like the Kafka Connect API.

Monitor your Kafka cluster performance to ensure that it is meeting your throughput requirements. You can use various tools to monitor Kafka, such as Kafka Manager, Confluent Control Center, or open source monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up Kafka to support a throughput of 10mm messages/hr on 2KB payloads. However, it's worth noting that the exact configuration will depend on your specific requirements and the nature of your workload, so you may need to adjust the settings and hardware accordingly.

Here's an example of how to configure a Kafka producer to support high throughput with 2KB payloads in Java:

import java.util.Properties;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.Producer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;

public class KafkaProducerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String topicName = "my-topic";
        String bootstrapServers = "localhost:9092";
        int numMessages = 10000000;
        int messageSizeBytes = 2000;

        // Configure the producer
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, bootstrapServers);
        props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
        props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
        props.put(ProducerConfig.BATCH_SIZE_CONFIG, "16384");
        props.put(ProducerConfig.LINGER_MS_CONFIG, "5");
        props.put(ProducerConfig.COMPRESSION_TYPE_CONFIG, "snappy");

        // Create the producer
        Producer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);

        // Send messages
        for (int i =0; i < numMessages; i++) {
            String message = generateMessage(messageSizeBytes);
            ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>(topicName, message);
            producer.send(record);
        }

    // Close the producer
    producer.close();
}

private static String generateMessage(int sizeBytes) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(sizeBytes);
    for (int i = 0; i < sizeBytes; i++) {
        sb.append('x');
    }
    return sb.toString();
}
}

In this example, we configure the producer with a batch size of 16KB and a linger time of 5ms to optimize for high throughput. We also enable snappy compression to reduce the amount of data sent over the network. Finally, we generate 10 million messages with a payload size of 2KB and send them to a Kafka topic named "my-topic". Note that the exact configuration will depend on your specific requirements and may need to be adjusted accordingly.
