**Asynchronous process in Executor service**

In Java, the ExecutorService interface provides a way to execute tasks asynchronously using a thread pool. 
The ExecutorService manages a pool of worker threads and provides a high-level interface for submitting tasks to the pool.

To execute a task asynchronously with ExecutorService, you can do the following:

**Create an instance of ExecutorService using one of the factory methods in the Executors class.**
For example, to create a fixed-size thread pool with 5 threads, you can use the following code:

ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);

**Create a Runnable or Callable task that you want to execute asynchronously. For example:**

Runnable task = () -> {
    // code to be executed asynchronously
};

Submit the task to the executor service using one of the submit() methods. 
This will enqueue the task for execution by one of the worker threads in the pool. 
The submit() method returns a Future object that you can use to 
check the status of the task or obtain its result (if it returns a value).

Future<?> future = executor.submit(task);

Optionally, you can wait for the task to complete using the get() method on the Future object. 
This will block the current thread until the task completes and returns its result (if any).

future.get(); // wait for task to complete

When you are done using the executor service, you should shut it down using the shutdown() method. 
This will stop the worker threads in the pool and release any resources used by the executor service.

executor.shutdown();

By using ExecutorService to execute tasks asynchronously, you can take advantage of 
multiple threads to perform work in parallel and 
avoid blocking the main thread of your application.
