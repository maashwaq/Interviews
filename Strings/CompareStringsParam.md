**Compare strings with two parameters and determine if all characters in string one exist in second string**

To compare two strings in Java and determine if all the characters in the first string exist in the second string, 
you can use a nested loop to iterate over the characters in both strings and compare them. Here's an example code:

public static boolean compareStrings(String s1, String s2) {
    for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
        boolean found = false;
        for (int j = 0; j < s2.length(); j++) {
            if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j)) {
                found = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!found) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

This method takes two parameters s1 and s2, which are the two strings being compared. 
The method uses a nested loop to iterate over each character of both strings. 

For each character in the first string s1, the method checks if it exists in the second string s2. 
If the character is found, it sets the found flag to true and breaks out of the inner loop. 
If the character is not found, the method returns false, 
indicating that not all characters in the first string exist in the second string. 
If the loop completes without returning false, the method returns true, 
indicating that all characters in the first string exist in the second string.

You can call this method by passing the two strings you want to compare as parameters:

String s1 = "Hello";
String s2 = "Helloworld";
boolean result = compareStrings(s1, s2);
System.out.println(result); // prints true

In this example, the compareStrings() method is called with the strings "Hello" and "Helloworld" as parameters. 
The method returns true because all characters in the first string ("Hello") exist in the second string ("Helloworld").
